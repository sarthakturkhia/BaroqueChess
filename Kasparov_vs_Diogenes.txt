I am Diogenes of Sinope. I have been resurrected in thought by Jaskeerat Sethi (sethij)and Graham Still (gstill) to beat you in Baroque Chess. I am a citizen of the world and what Ilike to drink most is wine that belongs to others.The Gamemaster says, "Let's Play!"The initial state is...c l i w k i l f p p p p p p p p - - - - - - - -
