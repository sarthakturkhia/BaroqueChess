# BaroqueChess
CSE 415 Assignment 5

you will work with a partner to create a Python module (typically just a single .py file) that will be able to play a game of Baroque Chess and compete in a tournament. Although the tournament is not part of the assignment itself, your program must be technically able to participate in it. (The tournament will take place after the assignment is due; we may offer some extra credit for programs that place highly in the rankings.) Your player's file name should be of the form [free_name]_BC_Player.py, where you get to choose an original name, but that name is followed by "_BC_Player.py". An example might be Magnifico_BC_Player.py. If you need to split your agent to use any additional modules, please name them using the convention: [free_name]_BC_module_[module_name].py. Here an example could be Magnifico_BC_module_staticevaluation.py.
It will be essential that your program use the specified representation of states, so that it is compatible with all the other Baroque Chess programs developed in the class. Here is some code for representing states of Baroque Chess. (This is included as BC_state_etc.py in the starter code.)
